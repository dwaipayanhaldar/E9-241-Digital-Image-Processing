# E9-241 Digital Image Processing (IISc)

This repository contains all assignments and project work completed for the **E9-241 Digital Image Processing** course at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc).  
It provides implementations of classical image processing techniques and algorithms, focusing on both theory and hands-on experimentation.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents
- Organized by assignment (e.g., `Assignment_1`, `Assignment_2`, â€¦)
- Each assignment includes:
  - Python / Jupyter Notebook code (histograms, filtering, thresholding, segmentation, etc.)
  - Input images and generated outputs for visualization and comparison

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals & Skills Demonstrated
- Understanding of fundamental image processing operations: **filtering**, **edge detection**, **binarization**, **connected-component labeling**, and more
- Implementation of **adaptive algorithms** (e.g., variable-window Otsu binarization)
- Emphasis on both correctness and performance
